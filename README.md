# Soul Cage - Alternate Firmware

This is an alter√•nate firmware for [SoulCage -- the Digital Trapped Soul
Pendant](https://github.com/vishalsoniindia/SoulCage---The-Digital-Trapped-Soul-Pendant).

I created it because the video inside is an 8 second loop.  It gets
repetitive.  I do some things to interrupt the repetition.

* The backlight flickers erratically, giving brief glimpses of the souls
  inside.

* There are short bursts of white noise static to interrupt the video
  and obscure it even more.

Other features

 - faster frame rate - I keep the video at ~7 FPS, but the screen
   refreshes at 50 FPS so the static bursts can be fast.

 - It randomly changes between the male and female souls during the
   longer dark periods.  There's no more nvs/power cycling trick -- you
   always get a random soul, and it will switch eventually.

# Install from Binaries

There are prebuilt binaries in the prebuilt directory.  To install them,
you need the `esptool` utility.  `esptool` is included in Arduino,
ESP-IDF, PlatformIO, and ESPhome, among others, so you may already have
it.  It may be called `esptool.py` or `esptool.exe` on Windows.  If so,
substitute the tool name you have.

Attach the SoulCage with a USB cable and find its serial port.

Open a terminal (use WSL if you're on Windows), navigate into the
`prebuilt` directory, and type this command.  Substitute the actual name
or path of your `esptool` and serial port.

    [YOUR_ESPTOOL_PATH] --chip esp32s3 \
                        -p [YOUR_SERIAL_PORT] \
                        -b 460800 \
                        --before=default_reset \
                        --after=hard_reset \
                          write_flash \
                        --flash_mode dio \
                        --flash_freq 80m \
                        --flash_size 16MB \
                          0x0 bootloader.bin \
                          0x10000 SoulCage.bin \
                          0x8000 partition-table.bin \
                          0x100000 Intro.bin \
                          0x36b000 soul_f.bin \

# Build from Source

Install and configure ESP-IDF.  [Espressif
documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.5.1/esp32s3/get-started/index.html)
explains how.

This is a [multi-config
workspace](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/examples/build_system/cmake/multi_config/README.md).
You can build the default board, defined in `default-board.cmake`, or
you can build from a profile defined in `profiles/*`.  Each profile uses
its own build directory, so you can switch boards without having to
rebuild the world.

## Build the default board for the first time

  1. (optional) Edit `default-board.cmake` to set the default board.
  2. `idf.py set-target esp32s3`
  3. Attach your ESP32 board with USB and find its serial port.
  4. `idf.py --port=[port] build flash monitor`

  Note the screen is normally dark for about 15 seconds after the app
  starts.

## Build from a profile for the first time

  1. Find your board's profile in `profiles/`.
  2. Attach your board with USB and find its serial port.
  3. `idf.py @profiles/[your_board] --port=[port] build flash monitor`

## Rebuilding after changing the app

SoulCage puts the video streams in separate flash partitions.  After
the first build, you don't need to reflash them.  You can update just
the app with this command.
```
    $ idf.py --port=[port] app-flash monitor
```
(add `@profiles/[your_board]` if you're using a profile)


# Add Support for a New Board

It should be possible to make SoulCage run on more ESP32-based boards.
The process of adding a new board should go like this.  (I haven't done
it yet, so *caveat developer*.)

 - Pick a `shortname`.  Shell-friendly\*, unique, easy to type.
   
   E.g., `ws-128`, `ws-t169`.

 - Pick a `boardname`.  Shell-friendly\*, complete product name.
   
   E.g., `waveshare-esp32-s3-lcd-1.28`.

 - Pick a `configname`.  It must be a legal C identifier, uppercase.
   Transliterate `boardname` to uppercase and change punctuation to
   "\_".  It will have `BOARD_` prepended.

   E.g., `BOARD_WAVESHARE_ESP32_S3_LCD_1_28`.

   N.B., in some contexts, the build system prepends `CONFIG_` to the
   configname.

   E.g., `CONFIG_BOARD_WAVESHARE_ESP32_S3_LCD_1_28`.

 - Define `builddir` as `build/[shortname]`.

   E.g., `build/ws-128`.

 - Create `boards/sdkconfig.[boardname]`. sdkconfig parameters specific
   to this board.  This file should define `CONFIG_[configname]` and
   `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET`, among other things.

 - Create `profiles/[shortname]`.  It is is an
   [idf.py options file](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.5.1/esp32s3/api-guides/tools/idf-py.html#global-options).
   It should define:
    + `-B [builddir]`
    + `-D IDF_TARGET=esp32s3` (or whatever chip your board has)
    + `-D SDKCONFIG=[builddir]/sdkconfig`
    + `D board_config="boards/sdkconfig.[boardname]"`

 - Add `[configname]` to the board list in `main/Kconfig.projbuild`.

 - Add definitions to `main/include/board_defs.h`.
   Use the existing boards as examples.

\*"Shell friendly" means good for use in a shell or filename:

 - no whitespace
 - no punctuation characters with meaning to a shell (&lt; &gt; ~ etc.)
 - alphanumeric characters are okay.
 - "-", "\_", "." are okay.  Prefer "-" to "\_".


# More Needed

I want to make this available for Halloween 2025.  So I've published
some prebuilt binaries and instructions for flashing them.

~~You're welcome to build from source, but be warned, the code is a great
big mess.  I intend to clean it all up, but it will take a while.~~

**Update 2025-10-23:** Refactoring is complete.
This code is as good as it's going to get.  Enjoy!
