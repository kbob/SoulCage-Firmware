# Soul Cage - Alternate Firmware

This is an alternate firmware for [SoulCage -- the Digital Trapped Soul Pendant](https://github.com/vishalsoniindia/SoulCage---The-Digital-Trapped-Soul-Pendant).

I created it because the video inside is an 8 second loop.  It gets repetitive.  I do some things to interrupt the repetition.

* The backlight flickers erratically, giving brief glimpses of the souls inside.

* There are short bursts of white noise static to interrupt the video and obscure it even more.



 - faster frame rate - I keep the video at ~7 FPS, but the screen refreshes at 50 FPS so the static bursts can be fast.

 - It randomly changes between the male and female souls during the longer dark periods.  There's no more nvs/power cycling trick -- you always get a random soul, and it will switch eventually.
